CAN
Q1:
As described in the CAN basics of INtroduction to CAN bus and can frames can is chosen for the robustness of the stadnard.
With further ressearch I come up with:
Adtvantages:
-Built in Error detection /retransmision
-Asynchronous , high priority takes precendence
-Less wiring (simple twiser pair) compare to USB hub, PCIE board level (SPI also simple though)
-Broadcast,
Disadvantges
-Low data rate compare to USB or PCIE
-Limitaed payload size (8 byte normal can 64 byte CAN FD)(USB and PCIE are larger)
-Complex message management (this whole assignment)


Q2:
Embeded system: Error handling and asynchronous where errors and reactivtiy matter 
Powertrain: Same, real time sensors for the safety required for power management
DAQ: CAN broadcast ability means senssors can share wires



STM32 Chip Selection
The STM32H735xG meets all the requirements expect the flash memory.

For the A/D converter it has two of 16 bit resolution and a third of 12 bit resolution.
It only has 1024kb of memoery but no chips with 3 can busees and at least 3/ad converted had more flash memory, and flash memory could be optimised by condensing the firmware.
The chip has multiple package option so different physical size, from the smallest 0.35mm pitch to a the 24x 24 mm LQFP176.
It nees a suply voltage of 1.62-3.6V with 150uA Run mode. It's stocked at 16.90 the unit but for 500 unit which would probably make it a bad purchasing decision for redback.I would keep looking at other chips that fit the description.
